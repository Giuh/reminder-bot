# Reminder Bot
## Cool beans

[![Discord Bots](https://discordbots.org/api/widget/349920059549941761.svg)](https://discordbots.org/bot/349920059549941761)

Please note, if you're trying to run this yourself, you must manually disable the premium checker. This is as simple as changing the `get_patrons.py/get_patrons` method to return every discord user the bot can see (may be slow), or going through and removing all the checks yourself. Have fun!
