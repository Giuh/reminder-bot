__Key Commands__
  > `mbprefix <string>` - change the prefix from $ to anything less than 5 characters. This variable is stored on a per-server level. This command does not use a prefix!
  > `$help` - get a PM of this page.
  > `$blacklist [channel-name]` - block or unblock a channel from sending commands. If the bot has sufficient rights, it will also remove any commands in blacklisted channels.

__Reminder Commands__
  > `$del` - delete reminders and intervals on your server.
  > `$remind <server/me/channel-name/channel-mention> <time-to-reminder> <message>` - set up a reminder. Takes times in the format of \[num][s/m/h/d], for example 10s for 10 seconds, 2s10m for 2 seconds 10 minutes or 10m15s1h2d for 10 minutes, 15 seconds, 1 hour and 2 days.
  > `$event <server/me/channel-name/channel-mention> <date-and-time> <message>` - set up an event. Takes times in the format of \[minutes]m[hours]h[days]d[months]/[year]y, for example 0m0h31d12/2018y for 00:00 UTC on the 31st of December 2018.

Takes times in the format of \[num][s/m/h/d]. Ex. `$interval 0s 20m Hello World!` will send `Hello World!` to your channel every 20 minutes. `$interval 0s 20m -scope=other-channel Hello World!` is the same as typing the command in #other-channel..

__Help help__
  > a word surrounded by `<` `>` is a required argument
  > a word surrounded by `[` `]` is an optional argument
  > if there is a `/` in the argument name, this means you can choose between different things
  > do not type the brackets when you type out the command! For example, `mbprefix !`, not `mbprefix <!>`
  > if an argument looks like this: `[-scope=<channel>]`, it is optional and requires you to type `-scope=` to use. For example, `-scope=my-channel-name`.
